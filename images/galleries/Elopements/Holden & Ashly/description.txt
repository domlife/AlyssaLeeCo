Holden & Ashly have such a deep bond together that it feels like they are your family the first time you meet them! It's a match that was truly made in heaven and blessed by the universe. It was so magical watching and feeling the impact that their love has on their family and friends. This elopement was very special to me and I was very honored to be able to capture it for them.
